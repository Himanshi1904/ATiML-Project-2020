# ATiML-Project-2020

This project is part of one of our courses in university. 
- In this project we were suppose to extract meaningful features from a dataset consisting of approx 1000 books from Gutenberg corpus. 
- Once we have the features (for instance: TTR aka Type Token Ratio, Sentiments etc), next step was to train a model with the features obtained and check for accuracy of the model. 
- Dataset is highly imbalanced. Models selected for experimentations were compared against BagofWords Model.
